# rf-variable-selection-microarray

Variable selection for classification of cancer microarray dataset is challenging for the big p and
small n data settings and the multi-class imbalanced data problem. This project proposes a
variable selection method that can handle the multi-class imbalanced microarray datasets using
a random forest quantile classifier (RFQ).
